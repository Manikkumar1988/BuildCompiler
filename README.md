# 100-days-of-code-log

**Main target:** ***I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.***

Actually it is a challenge for 100 days to make a habit of everyday coding to develop my skill sets.  I inspired by [Alexander Kallaway](https://github.com/Kallaway "Alexander Kallaway") #100DaysOfCode challenge. More details about the challenge can be found here: [100daysofcode.com](http://100daysofcode.com/ "100daysofcode.com") or [the official repo](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code "the official repo").

## Goals
- Make habit of coding daily & learn everyday
- Revisit Core CS for deeper knowledge
- Make some real world projects for my portfolio
- Grab Course Compilation certification Compiler


## Log

### Day 04: Jun 25, 2019, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: 
Revised whole section of lexical analyser & Finite Automata
I would like take stab, and answer my own questions
 - What is Lexical Analysis?
 - Whats the motivation behind the Lexical Analyser?
 - Why Lexical Analysis?
 - How come Lexical Analysis is first phase of Compilation
 - Natural Languages Vs Formal Languages Vs Regular Languages
 - What is difference between Lexical Analysis and Lexical Specifications
 - How Lexical specification can be defined by Regex
 - Why Finite Automata?
 - How to Convert to NFA to DFA, Regex to NFA(or ViceVersa), lexical specification to regex

**Link to work:** 
TBU

**New thing(s) learned:** 
- Maxima Munch
- 

**Thoughts:**  
Isolated, not sure whether I would be able to get certificate within #100DaysOfCode.
Reason is whatever thought in the video lectures
- Need to stregthen the regex like find more than one way of specifing the regex
- Practise on Conversion

### Day 0: Jun 21, 2019, Friday

**Today's Progress**: 
- What is Compiler? Intrepreter? 
- Five stages of Compiler
- Bit of Compiler History

**Source:** 
- https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/Engineering/Compilers/Fall2014/about

**New thing(s) learned:** 
- On Terminal: to execute any last executed command, just type double exclamation marks, and hit ENTER (or !<first letter of command>)

**Thoughts:**  At last able to start the chellenge and do some real coding. Enjoyed the time and work. Wish to have a great journeyðŸ˜‡

### Day 1: Jun 22, 2019, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Goals of Lexical Analyser are
- Identify lexeme
- Associate token class to it

**Link to work:** 

**New thing(s) learned:** 
- Lexeme -> Compiler lingo, just a substring of program
- regular languages: are used to specify the lexical structure of programming languages. 
- lexical structure: of a programming language is a set of token classes. 
- Each one of the token classes: consists of some set of strings. 
- To specify which set of strings belongs to each token class the usual tool is regular languages.

**Thoughts:**  
Identifying lexeme itself problematic -> solution look ahead (however minimize it)

------------

### Day 03: Jun 24, 2019, Monday

**Today's Progress**
Able to articulate what is regex, FA, NFA, DFA.
Able to answer:
- "Why Lexical Analyser"?
- "Why Lexical Analyser is first phase of compiler?"

**Link to work:** 
None, just going through videos of 'Alex Aiken'

**New thing(s) learned:** 
Vague picture of Jflex's role in buidling the lexical analyser
keywords: Formal language, regular language, regular expression, FA, NFA, DFA, Lexical Specification

**Thoughts:**  Feeling little scared of new tools like Jflex, virtual machine, commandline commands,
